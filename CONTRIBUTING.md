## Pull Request Process

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/infobiotech/php-json-cache).

1. [Fork our repository](<https://github.com/infobiotech/php-json-cache/fork>).

2. Create one feature branch per feature (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`) - We won't pull from your master branch.

3. Use [PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

4. Document any change in behaviour - Make sure the [README.md](README.md) and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

5. Add tests - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

6. Ensure tests pass! - Please run the tests (see below) before submitting your pull request, and make sure they pass. We won't accept a patch until all tests pass.

7. Ensure no coding standards violations - Please run PHP Code Sniffer using the PSR-2 standard (see [Running PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/infobiotech/php-json-cache#running-php-code-sniffer)) before submitting your pull request. A violation will cause the build to fail, so please make sure there are no violations. We can't accept a patch if the build fails.

8. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.

9. Try to follow [SemVer](http://semver.org/) versioning scheme.

10. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that the Pull Request would represent.

11. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`).

12. Send coherent history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.

13. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`).

14. Create a new Pull Request - Please one pull request per feature. If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
